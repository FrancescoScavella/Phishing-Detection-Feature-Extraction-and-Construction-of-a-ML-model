# Phishing-Detection-Feature-Extraction-and-Construction-of-a-ML-model


In this project, we built an ML model that predicts whether a URL poses a phishing threat using only features extracted from the string, achieving an accuracy of 87%.

We started with a raw dataset containing only the URLs and extracted numerous features. The construction of some features required an in-depth frequency analysis of special characters and TLDs within the URLs.
